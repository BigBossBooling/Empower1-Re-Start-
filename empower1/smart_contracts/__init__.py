# This file makes Python treat the `smart_contracts` directory as a sub-package of `empower1`.

# It's good practice to define any constants or shared utilities for smart contracts here,
# or to import key contract classes for easier access from other modules.

# Example:
# from .stimulus_contract import StimulusContract
# from .tax_contract import TaxContract
