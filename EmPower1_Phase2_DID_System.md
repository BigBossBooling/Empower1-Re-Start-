# EmPower1 Decentralized Identity (DID) System - Initial Framework

## 1. Introduction

The purpose of this document is to conceptualize the initial framework for a Decentralized Identity (DID) system on the EmPower1 blockchain. This system is designed to empower users with self-sovereign control over their digital identities, facilitate selective and privacy-preserving data disclosure, and underpin fair and transparent processes critical to EmPower1's mission, such as equitable stimulus distribution and secure access to decentralized applications (dApps).

## 2. Why (Strategic Rationale & Design Philosophy Alignment)

The EmPower1 DID system is founded on core principles that align directly with the blockchain's overarching mission:

*   **User-Controlled Identity (Self-Sovereignty):** This is paramount. The DID system actualizes EmPower1's goal of empowerment by shifting control over identity data from centralized authorities to individual users. Users own and manage their digital identities.
*   **Selective Disclosure & Privacy:** In synergy with future conceptual "Privacy Protocols," DIDs enable users to disclose only the necessary pieces of information for specific interactions or services, significantly enhancing personal privacy and data minimization.
*   **Fair and Transparent Stimulus Distribution:** DIDs can serve as a verifiable and unique (yet potentially pseudonymous for privacy) basis for distributing stimulus payments and other benefits. This helps reduce fraud, ensures aid reaches intended recipients, and provides an auditable mechanism for such distributions.
*   **Secure dApp Access & Reputation:** DIDs can be used for authentication and authorization within the EmPower1 dApp ecosystem. Over time, reputation can be associated with a DID through verifiable attestations, without necessarily revealing underlying personal data, fostering trust and accountability.
*   **Reduced Reliance on Centralized Authorities:** By providing a decentralized mechanism for identity assertion and verification, the system diminishes dependence on traditional centralized identity providers, fostering a more resilient and truly decentralized ecosystem.

## 3. What (Conceptual Component, Data Structures, Core Logic)

This section details the core components, data structures, and logic of the EmPower1 DID system, ensuring alignment with global standards.

### 3.1. Adherence to W3C DID Specifications

The EmPower1 DID method will be designed for full compliance with the **W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0 specification**. This ensures interoperability with a growing ecosystem of DID-compliant tools and services and leverages established standards for security and data modeling. The EmPower1 DID method identifier will be, for example, `did:empower1`.

### 3.2. DID Structure

An EmPower1 DID will be a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) with the following structure:
`did:empower1:<unique-blockchain-generated-identifier>`

The `<unique-blockchain-generated-identifier>` will be a cryptographically generated, unique string, managed by the EmPower1 DID registry.

### 3.3. DID Document

Associated with every EmPower1 DID is a DID Document, typically a JSON or JSON-LD object, which contains the information necessary to use the DID.

*   **Key Components of the DID Document (as per W3C specification):**
    *   `@context`: Specifies the JSON-LD context(s) used in the document (e.g., the official W3C DID context, potentially EmPower1 specific extensions).
    *   `id`: The DID URI itself (e.g., `did:empower1:abcdef123456`).
    *   `verificationMethod`: An array of objects describing cryptographic public keys associated with the DID. These keys are used for authentication, signing Verifiable Credentials, data encryption, etc. Each method includes:
        *   `id`: A URI identifying the verification method (e.g., `did:empower1:abcdef123456#key-1`).
        *   `type`: The cryptographic suite used (e.g., `EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019`, `Ed25519VerificationKey2020`).
        *   `controller`: The DID that is authorized to make changes to this verification method (typically the DID subject itself).
        *   `publicKeyJwk` (JSON Web Key) or `publicKeyMultibase` (multibase encoded public key): The actual public key material.
    *   `authentication`: A list of verification methods (referencing `id`s from `verificationMethod`) that the DID subject can use to prove control of the DID for authentication purposes.
    *   `assertionMethod`: Verification methods used for issuing Verifiable Credentials or making other assertions as the DID subject.
    *   `keyAgreement`: Verification methods used for establishing encrypted communication channels with the DID subject.
    *   `capabilityInvocation`: Verification methods used when the DID subject needs to invoke a capability, such as signing a transaction for a smart contract or authorizing an action.
    *   `service` (Optional): An array of objects describing service endpoints that enable interaction with the DID subject. Examples include:
        *   `id`: A URI identifying the service endpoint (e.g., `did:empower1:abcdef123456#messaging`).
        *   `type`: The type of the service (e.g., `EncryptedMessagingService`, `VerifiableCredentialRepository`).
        *   `serviceEndpoint`: The URL or other identifier for the service.
*   **EmPower1 Specific Extensions (Conceptual):**
    *   Within the `service` array or as a custom field in the DID Document, there could be entries specifically designed to support EmPower1's mission. For example, a service endpoint could point to a user-managed data vault where privacy-preserving attestations of eligibility for certain stimulus programs are stored (as Verifiable Credentials).
    *   Any such extensions must be carefully designed with ethical considerations, privacy, and user consent as paramount, ensuring they do not inadvertently compromise the self-sovereign nature of the DID.

### 3.4. DID Method Operations (CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Deactivate)

The EmPower1 DID method will support the following fundamental operations:

*   **Create (Register):**
    1.  A user (typically via their wallet application) generates one or more new cryptographic key pairs. One of these will be designated as the initial controlling key for the DID (the "DID Key" as per user directive).
    2.  A transaction (e.g., `DIDCreateTx` as defined in `EmPower1_Phase1_Transaction_Model.md`) is constructed. This transaction includes the public key(s) and other essential information for the initial DID Document.
    3.  The transaction is submitted to the EmPower1 blockchain.
    4.  The blockchain (via the DID registry smart contract or native module) validates the transaction, allocates a unique identifier for the new DID, and stores the initial DID Document (or its hash/pointer).
*   **Read (Resolve):**
    1.  Given a DID URI (e.g., `did:empower1:abcdef123456`), any entity (user, dApp, service) can query the EmPower1 blockchain (or a trusted cache/resolver) to retrieve the latest version of the associated DID Document.
    2.  This is a public, permissionless operation, essential for verifying signatures and discovering service endpoints.
*   **Update:**
    1.  The DID controller (the entity that can prove control of one of the keys listed in the `authentication` or `capabilityInvocation` section of the current DID Document) wishes to update the DID Document.
    2.  An update transaction (e.g., `DIDUpdateTx`) is constructed, specifying the changes (e.g., adding/removing keys, updating service endpoints, rotating authentication keys). This transaction must be signed by a currently authorized key.
    3.  The blockchain validates the signature and applies the update to the DID Document.
    4.  A mechanism for versioning DID Documents (e.g., sequence number, timestamp, transaction hash) is important for auditability.
*   **Revoke (Deactivate - Optional in W3C Core, but considered good practice):**
    1.  The DID controller can submit a transaction to effectively deactivate the DID.
    2.  Upon deactivation, the DID Document might be updated to indicate its revoked status, or the resolution process might explicitly return a "deactivated" state. This prevents further use of the DID for new interactions.

### 3.5. Integration with Crypto Package's DID Key Generation/Parsing (User Directive)

A core "crypto package" or library, available across EmPower1 development tools (node, SDKs, wallets), will be responsible for:
*   **Generating Key Pairs:** Creating cryptographic key pairs (e.g., ECDSA secp256k1, Ed25519) that are compliant with the types specified for `verificationMethod` in DID Documents.
*   **Parsing Public Keys:** Correctly parsing public key material (`publicKeyJwk`, `publicKeyMultibase`) from resolved DID Documents to enable signature verification.
*   **Signing and Verification:** Providing functions for signing messages or transactions using the private keys associated with a DID's verification methods, and for verifying such signatures using the public keys from the DID Document.

## 4. How (High-Level Implementation Strategies & Technologies)

*   **On-Chain DID Registry Implementation:**
    *   **Option 1: Smart Contract Registry:**
        *   A dedicated smart contract (e.g., written in Rust for WASM) manages the lifecycle of DIDs: registration, updates, and resolution of DID Documents.
        *   *Pros:* Offers flexibility in logic, upgradability (with careful governance), and can be developed and deployed relatively quickly within the existing smart contract framework.
        *   *Cons:* Interactions (create, update) may incur higher gas costs compared to native implementations. Resolution might also have gas costs if it involves contract calls.
    *   **Option 2: Native Module/Protocol Feature:**
        *   DID operations are handled by a specialized, pre-compiled module built directly into the EmPower1 blockchain protocol.
        *   *Pros:* Potentially more efficient (lower gas costs for operations), tighter integration with other core protocol features (e.g., transaction validation).
        *   *Cons:* Less flexible; changes or new features require a core protocol upgrade (hard fork or significant soft fork). Development can be more complex.
    *   **Recommendation for Initial Framework:** Begin with a **Smart Contract Registry**. This approach leverages the flexibility of the WASM smart contract platform, allowing for quicker iteration and easier adaptation as the DID ecosystem evolves. If DID operations become a significant performance bottleneck for the entire network, native optimizations for specific functions can be explored in later phases.

*   **Storage of DID Documents:**
    *   **Option 1: Full On-Chain Storage:**
        *   The entire DID Document (JSON-LD structure) is stored directly on the EmPower1 blockchain within the state of the DID registry smart contract or native module.
        *   *Pros:* Highest availability, immutability, and tamper-resistance. Resolution is direct.
        *   *Cons:* Can be expensive in terms of blockchain storage costs, especially if DID Documents become large (many keys, complex service endpoints, long string values). This could lead to higher gas fees for creation and updates.
    *   **Option 2: Hybrid (Pointer-Based) Storage:**
        *   A cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA256) of the DID Document is stored on-chain. The actual DID Document is stored off-chain in a content-addressable system like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System - synergy with Phase 4.4) or another decentralized storage network.
        *   *Pros:* Significantly lower on-chain storage costs. Accommodates large and complex DID Documents more easily.
        *   *Cons:* Resolution becomes a two-step process (fetch hash from chain, then fetch document from off-chain store). Availability and retrievability depend on the health and performance of the off-chain storage system.
    *   **Recommendation for Initial Framework:** Start with **Full On-Chain storage** for DID Documents. This prioritizes simplicity, robustness, and direct resolvability for the initial framework. Design DID Documents to be concise initially. Plan and build capabilities for a hybrid (pointer-based) approach to be introduced as the system scales, DID use cases become more complex, or if on-chain storage costs become a concern.

*   **Transaction Types:** Utilize the conceptual `DIDCreateTx` and `DIDUpdateTx` (and potentially `DIDDeactivateTx`) as defined in the `EmPower1_Phase1_Transaction_Model.md`. These transactions will carry the necessary payloads for DID operations.
*   **Libraries and Tooling:**
    *   Leverage existing, well-audited libraries for handling W3C DID data models, JSON-LD processing, and core cryptographic operations (as per section 3.5) in relevant languages (Go for the node, Rust/WASM for smart contracts, JavaScript/TypeScript for wallet SDKs and web tools).

## 5. Synergies

The EmPower1 DID System is a foundational component with extensive synergies:

*   **Wallet System (`EmPower1_Phase1_Wallet_System.md`):** Wallets will be the primary user interface for DID management. Users will create DIDs, manage their keys, authorize operations using DID-controlled keys, and potentially manage Verifiable Credentials associated with their DIDs.
*   **Privacy Protocol (Conceptual - User Mention):** DIDs are fundamental to many privacy-enhancing technologies. They enable pseudonymous interactions, and when combined with Verifiable Credentials (VCs), allow users to selectively disclose verified pieces of information about themselves without revealing their entire identity or relying on centralized intermediaries.
*   **Transaction Model (`EmPower1_Phase1_Transaction_Model.md`):** Specific transaction types (`DIDCreateTx`, `DIDUpdateTx`) are defined to facilitate the on-chain management of DIDs and their associated documents.
*   **Stimulus Distribution & Social dApps:** DIDs can provide a stable, user-controlled, and potentially privacy-preserving identifier for determining eligibility, distributing funds, and accessing services within socially impactful dApps.
*   **Smart Contracts (`EmPower1_Phase2_Smart_Contracts.md`):** Smart contracts can be designed to interact with DIDs, for example, by requiring authentication via a DID signature, checking for specific attestations linked to a DID (via VCs), or being administered by a DID controller.
*   **Multi-Signature Wallets (`EmPower1_Phase2_Multi_Signature_Wallets.md`):** A DID itself could be controlled by a multi-signature mechanism. This means that updates to the DID Document or the use of its associated keys would require approval from multiple authorized entities, suitable for organizational or shared DIDs.
*   **Decentralized Data Storage (IPFS - Phase 4.4):** If a hybrid storage model for DID Documents is adopted in later phases, IPFS or similar systems would be crucial for storing the actual DID Document content off-chain, referenced by an on-chain hash.

## 6. Anticipated Challenges & Conceptual Solutions

*   **Key Management for Users:**
    *   *Challenge:* Securely managing the private cryptographic keys that control a DID is a significant responsibility for users and can be a barrier to adoption if too complex.
    *   *Conceptual Solution:* Develop intuitive key management features within EmPower1 wallets, including robust backup mechanisms (e.g., mnemonic recovery phrases, seed splitting) and recovery options. Plan for future integration with hardware wallets. Provide extensive user education on key security best practices. Explore social recovery or guardian-based recovery mechanisms that can be linked to DIDs.
*   **Interoperability with other DID Methods/Systems:**
    *   *Challenge:* Ensuring that `did:empower1` DIDs can be resolved, understood, and trusted across different blockchain ecosystems and by various DID-compliant applications.
    *   *Conceptual Solution:* Strict adherence to W3C DID Core specifications and related standards (e.g., for key types, DID Resolution). Active participation in interoperability initiatives and working groups like the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF).
*   **User Education on Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI):**
    *   *Challenge:* SSI is a novel paradigm for many individuals accustomed to traditional, centralized identity systems. Understanding its benefits, responsibilities, and operational aspects requires education.
    *   *Conceptual Solution:* Develop clear, accessible documentation, tutorials, and guides. Design wallet UIs to be intuitive, explaining DID concepts contextually. Launch educational campaigns and community workshops to promote understanding of SSI.
*   **Privacy vs. Public Nature of Blockchain:**
    *   *Challenge:* DID Documents, when stored on a public blockchain, are publicly readable. This can raise privacy concerns if not managed carefully.
    *   *Conceptual Solution:* Emphasize that DIDs are pseudonymous by default. Strongly advise against storing any sensitive personal data directly within the DID Document itself. Promote the use of Verifiable Credentials for sharing specific, attested claims in a privacy-preserving manner, with user consent for each disclosure. Service endpoints in DID Documents should also be defined with privacy considerations (e.g., using intermediaries or privacy-enhancing protocols if needed).
*   **Scalability of DID Registry:**
    *   *Challenge:* A large number of DIDs, coupled with frequent updates or resolutions, could potentially strain the capacity of the on-chain DID registry (whether smart contract or native module).
    *   *Conceptual Solution:* Design the DID registry smart contract (or native module) for maximum efficiency and optimized storage. Implement efficient indexing mechanisms for fast DID resolution. Explore Layer-2 solutions or off-chain DID resolution caching mechanisms for high-volume scenarios in the future.
*   **Governance of the DID Method (`did:empower1`):**
    *   *Challenge:* Establishing a clear process for how the `did:empower1` method specification itself is maintained, updated, or potentially upgraded if new W3C standards emerge or improvements are needed.
    *   *Conceptual Solution:* Implement a community-driven governance process for proposing and approving changes to the DID method specification. Ensure clear versioning for the specification and its implementations. Align with EmPower1's overall governance model (Phase 5).
